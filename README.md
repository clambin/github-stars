Receives Star events from GitHub and posts them to Slack.

## Configuring a GitHub App
github-stars is implemented as a GitHub App: rather than the server polling for new stars, a GitHub App will forward
the events to a webhook when they occur.

To configure a GitHub app:

- Go to your GitHub account or organization settings.
- Navigate to Settings > Developer settings > GitHub Apps.
- Click New GitHub App.
- Fill in the details:
  - GitHub App Name: Choose a name for your app.
  - Homepage URL: Enter a valid URL (e.g., your appâ€™s website or GitHub profile).
  - Webhook URL: Add the endpoint where your app will receive event notifications.
  - Webhook secret: Add a secure secret string
- In the Repository Permissions section, grant the following permission:
  - Metadata: Read-only (required to identify repositories).
- In the Subscribe to Events section, check the Star event.
- Save your app.
- Install the app to your account. You can give access to all repositories, or a subset.


## Configuring github-stars

github-stars supports the following commandline options:

```aiignore

  -addr string
        Prometheus handler address (default ":9091")
  -debug
        Enable debug mode
  -directory string
        Database directory (default ".")
  -github.token string
        GitHub API token
  -github.webhook.addr string
        Address for the webhook server (default ":8080")
  -github.webhook.secret string
        Secret for the webhook server (default "todo")
  -include_archived
        Include archived repositories
  -slack.webHook string
        Slack WebHook URL
  -user string
        GitHub username

```

At a minimum, you will need to configure:

- github.token: a GitHub personal access token granting access to your repositories.
- github.webHook.secret: the Webhook secret configured in the GitHub app.
- user: your GitHub account name.
- slack.webHook: the Slack webHook to use to post to your Slack workspace / channel.
